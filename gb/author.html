      <h1>Author's Note</h1>
		  <hr>
      <p>I worked for Gordon for a couple of summers in my last years
      of high school and early university. Between Mae's wonderful cooking and
      Gordon's untiring ability and willingness to share stories about flying
      and the war, those summers will always be some of the fondest memories I
      have of being a teenager.</p>

      <p>Gordon and I would often take on yard work
      projects when the weather didn't permit us to be in the field. I remember
      one such "contingency" project of bin painting that lent itself particularly
      well to an ongoing question-and-answer period about Gordon's experiences
      and perspectives on the world. By the end of the summer, not only had we
      done a nice job of cleaning up the farm bins, but I had learned more
      about history and world politics than in the previous entire year of
      social studies in school!</p>

      <p>When I became a teacher a few years later and embarked on a significant
      Canadian history project with my students, I contacted Gordon to see if he
      would be willing to share some of his stories once again, this time with
      students from across Canada. Gordon agreed and proceeded to contribute
      some of the project's most detailed and illuminating experiences of the
      participating veterans.</p>

      <p>At one point during that project, I remember telling Gordon about another veteran pilot whom we interviewed who had won
      the Distinguished Flying Cross. Gordon acknowledged just what a
      significant recognition that was for a pilot, typically requiring a record
      of more than 25 completed missions. For the first time, I asked Gordon how
      many missions he had flown. He said 42! I discovered that Gordon had earned his own
      DFC during the war for a record of missions that I had somehow never asked
      about and he had never felt important enough to mention.</p>

      <p>Today, I am sad for the loss of my friend. But I'm so grateful that I was
      able to know him for the time that I did. He was a tribute to both our
      community and our country and we should all feel richer for having our
      lives touched by him. Thank you Gordon.</p>
